# Project Planner

Time management tools can be very useful, both at home and at work. There are several applications that help in tracking the progress of daily chores and activities. This project will use Python's tuples, sets, and graphical modules to create a planner for developing a small gaming app.

## How it works
This planner will create a schedule to help users plan their work. The program will display a window with a button that a user can press to choose a project file. It will then read a list of tasks from the file and sort them in the order of their startup time based on certain prerequisites. The resulting data will be converted into a chart that will display when each task starts and ends.

## Where this is used
Reading data from files and processing it is common to almost all programs, even the ones that do not use documents in an obvious manner (for example, games). The basic task of opening windows, laying out buttons, and drawing custom elements are the building blocks of any desktop application.
